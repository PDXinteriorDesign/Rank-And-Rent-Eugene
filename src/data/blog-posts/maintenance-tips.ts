Seasonal Maintenance Checklist

● Spring: Inspect for winter damage, clean gutters, and remove debris.
● Summer: Check for signs of sun damage, such as cracked or curled shingles.
● Fall: Clear leaves and debris, and ensure gutters are ready for rain.
● Winter: Look for ice dams and ensure proper attic insulation.

Preventative Measures

● Trim Overhanging Branches: Prevent damage from falling limbs and reduce moss growth.
● Clean Gutters Regularly: Clogged gutters can lead to water damage and roof leaks.
● Inspect for Moss and Algae: Eugene's damp climate makes roofs prone to moss growth. Remove it promptly to avoid damage.
