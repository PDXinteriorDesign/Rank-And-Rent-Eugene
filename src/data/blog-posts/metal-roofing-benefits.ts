Benefits of Metal Roofing

● Durability: Metal roofs can last 50 years or more, outlasting traditional asphalt shingles.
● Weather Resistance: They're designed to handle heavy rain, wind, and even snow.

Things to Consider

● Upfront Cost: Metal roofing is more expensive initially, but its longevity often makes up for the investment.
● Noise: While some worry about noise during rain, proper insulation can minimize this.
● Aesthetic Options: Metal roofs come in a variety of styles and colors to match your home's design.
