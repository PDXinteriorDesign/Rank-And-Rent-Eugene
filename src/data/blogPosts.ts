Why Preventative Maintenance Matters?
Regular maintenance helps identify potential issues before they become major problems. Professional inspections can save you money in the long run by catching small repairs early. Eugene's climate, with its heavy rainfall and occasional wind storms, makes regular roof inspections particularly important for local homeowners.
